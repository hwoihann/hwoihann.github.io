# Aim
With my eyes gradually broadened by research and network, I felt the knowledge I got from elementary education was far more than enough or useful. Lots of necessary skills and ideas still needs deepening and organizing, behind which is a urgent call of high living quality.

Therefore, this blog was built with the aim of encouraging me to achieve a more comprehensive self-study, a better research career and a more comfortable future life. To some extent, my study pattern is going to be revised against the old one, and much knowledge should be learnt from new angles. Thus comes the name of my blog:). 

Just be a life hacker, DIY any thing that I want in my life. As simple as possible, keep learning new ideas and technologies!
